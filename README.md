# MyCalendar - Event Scheduling and Conflict Resolution System

A backend service for collaborative calendar system that supports scheduling meetings between multiple participants, ensuring no time conflicts, handling timezone differences, and providing automatic conflict resolution suggestions.

## Architecture

The system implements Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API/             # REST Controllers and HTTP endpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application/     # Business logic and services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Domain/          # Core entities (User, Meeting)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Infrastructure/  # Data repositories and database access
```

**Technologies**: .NET 8, Entity Framework Core, PostgreSQL, xUnit

## Core Features

- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically checks for scheduling conflicts across participants
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Provides up to 3 alternative time slots when conflicts occur
- **Multi-Timezone Support**: Handles participants in different time zones with working hours validation
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Uses optimized queries for handling thousands of meetings per user
- **Working Hours Overlap Analysis**: Calculates common available time windows between participants

## Data Model

### User
- Unique ID, Name, TimeZone
- Working hours: 08:00-18:00 local time

### Meeting
- Unique ID, Title, StartTime (UTC), EndTime (UTC), List of Participants

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK
- PostgreSQL

### Configuration

**Database Setup**: The project comes with a pre-configured AWS RDS PostgreSQL database that is already set up and ready to use. No additional database configuration is required.

The connection string in `appsettings.json` is already configured:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=database-1.c4pg4geema71.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com;Database=MyCalendar;Username=postgres;Password=postgres123"
  }
}
```

**Optional - Local Database Setup**: If you prefer to use your own local PostgreSQL database:

1. Install PostgreSQL locally
2. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=MyCalendar;Username=postgres;Password=your-password"
  }
}
```
3. Apply database migrations:
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### Running the Application

```bash
cd src/MyCalendar.API
dotnet run
```

The application will be available at:
- **API Documentation**: `https://localhost:5089/swagger`
- **Interactive Demo**: `https://localhost:5089/demo`

## üéØ Interactive Demo

The project includes a comprehensive web-based demo interface that showcases all system capabilities:

### Demo Features
- **üë§ User Management**: Create and manage users with different timezones
- **üìÖ Meeting Scheduling**: Schedule meetings with real-time conflict detection
- **üîç Conflict Analysis**: Analyze working hours overlap between participants
- **üìä Calendar View**: Visual calendar with meeting display and timezone handling
- **‚ö° Real-time Testing**: Interactive API testing with immediate feedback

### Demo Highlights
- **Global Timezone Support**: Test with users from Japan, Brazil, USA, Europe, and more
- **Conflict Detection**: See intelligent suggestions when scheduling conflicts occur
- **Visual Calendar**: Week view showing meetings across different timezones
- **Smart Suggestions**: Get optimal meeting times based on participant availability
- **Request Logging**: Monitor all API calls and responses in real-time

### Quick Demo Workflow
1. **Start the application** and navigate to `/demo`
2. **Create sample users** from different timezones using the "Create Sample Data" button
3. **Schedule meetings** and observe conflict detection in action
4. **View the calendar** to see meetings displayed in UTC with timezone context
5. **Analyze conflicts** to understand working hours overlap between global participants

The demo interface provides a complete testing environment without requiring external tools like Postman or curl.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/users` | Create user with timezone |
| `GET` | `/api/users` | List all users |
| `POST` | `/api/meetings/schedule` | Schedule meeting with conflict detection |
| `GET` | `/api/meetings` | List all meetings |
| `POST` | `/api/meetings/analyze-conflicts` | Analyze working hours overlap |
| `GET` | `/api/meetings/available-slots` | Find available time slots |

## Usage Examples

### Creating Users
```bash
POST /api/users
{
  "name": "Jo√£o Silva",
  "timeZone": "UTC-3:00"
}
```

### Scheduling Meeting
```bash
POST /api/meetings/schedule
{
  "title": "Planning Meeting",
  "startTime": "2024-01-15T14:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2024-01-15T15:00:00Z",
  "participantIds": ["user1-id", "user2-id"]
}
```

### Response with Conflict
```json
{
  "isSuccess": false,
  "message": "Conflito de hor√°rio detectado",
  "suggestedTimeSlots": [
    {
      "startTime": "2024-01-15T15:00:00Z",
      "endTime": "2024-01-15T16:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Timezone Handling

The system correctly handles complex timezone scenarios:

### Standard Timezones
- UTC-3:00 (Brazil): 08:00-18:00 local = 11:00-21:00 UTC
- UTC+1:00 (Europe): 08:00-18:00 local = 07:00-17:00 UTC

### Midnight-Crossing Timezones
- UTC+9:00 (Japan): 08:00-18:00 local = 23:00-09:00 UTC (crosses midnight)
- UTC+10:00 (Australia): 08:00-18:00 local = 22:00-08:00 UTC (crosses midnight)

### Working Hours Overlap Calculation
The system calculates common working hours between participants. When participants are in time zones with no overlapping business hours, the system will indicate that no common working time exists. In such cases, meetings would require participants to work outside their normal business hours or arrange overtime.
